        <h1>Lucas Cantwell</h1>
        <p><u>My birthday is June 25th</u> and I was born in New York and i have lived there my whole life. I have a <i>cat</i> and a <b>dog</b>.<br>I like playing <strong>video games</strong> and watching <b>movies</b> though I will occasionally modify and edit <i><u>code</u></i> to fit something im trying to make because I like to try modding games sometimes (though i'm not very good at it right now) 
        <br><img src="images/Gohan.jpg" alt="Gohan showing an article he is working on"> <br><U>My academic goal</U> this year is to get good grades and not fail any classes I plan on trying to go down the path of coding or I.T. and personally I want to do some professional modding of some games if I end up getting skilled enough for that which may or may not include 3d modeling as well. This year I want to accomplish learning how to code some things so I can better familiarize myself with how it works.</p> <img src="images/unnamed.jpg" alt="Inspirational Goku image">
